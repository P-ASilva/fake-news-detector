1. Dataset
The dataset chosen for this project focuses on fake news detection in online media. It consists of labeled articles classified as either true or false, offering a clear business case for detecting misinformation. The goal is to assist platforms in curbing the spread of fake news by automatically assessing the credibility of a given article.

The dataset was initially discussed in the context of bridging the gap between AI and human linguistic judgment, as highlighted in the paper "AI vs linguistic-based human judgement: Bridging the gap in pursuit of truth for fake news detection" [1]. The business application, therefore, is to leverage AI models to assist human fact-checkers in quickly filtering out potentially harmful or misleading content.

2. Classification Pipeline
To tackle this problem, a classification pipeline was developed using the TF-IDF vectorization method for text feature extraction. The choice of this model was based on its efficiency in highlighting the most relevant words in each document, aiding the classifier in identifying key terms that may indicate fake news.

Additional pre-processing steps such as stemming, lemmatization, and the removal of stop words were considered to enhance the quality of the features. The bag-of-words approach, especially in conjunction with TF-IDF, is useful in this context because it captures word importance in a way that aligns with detecting common patterns in deceptive articles, as discussed in [1]. However, it is also worth noting that this model could be fooled by word manipulations, such as the strategic use of synonyms to bypass detection algorithms.

3. Evaluation
The classifier was evaluated using balanced accuracy as the main performance metric, given the possible imbalance in the dataset between true and false news. The train-test splits were shuffled multiple times to ensure that the results were not biased by any specific data partition.

Key terms like "breaking", "shocking", and "exclusive" were identified as highly influential for classification, as these terms often signal sensationalism, which is common in fake news. However, this raises the question of whether the classifier is merely picking up on superficial features, rather than truly understanding the context of the news articles, as discussed in [1].

4. Dataset Size
To assess the potential for improvement by increasing the dataset size, downsampling experiments were conducted. The results showed that performance improved steadily with larger training sets, indicating that more data could significantly enhance the model's ability to distinguish between real and fake news. However, given the nature of the fake news domain, acquiring a larger dataset may not be feasible without human intervention, as highlighted in the challenges mentioned in [1].

5. Topic Analysis
Using topic modeling methods such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), the dataset was broken down into distinct themes. It was observed that certain topics, such as those involving political news, were more prone to misclassification, possibly due to the high subjectivity and polarization in such content.

To refine the model, a two-layer classifier was implemented. In the first layer, documents were classified by topic, and in the second layer, specialized classifiers were applied to each topic. This hierarchical approach reduced the overall error rate, especially in more complex topics like politics, echoing the findings of [1], where context-specific judgments improve classification accuracy.
